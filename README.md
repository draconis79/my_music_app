# Review An Album!

We created an app for reviewing albums. There is full CRUD functionality, and deployment on Heroku.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- Angular
- Express
- Ruby
- Ruby on Rails
- CSS
- HTML
- Atom

## Approach

This app was built with a Rails back end and an Angular/Express front end. It uses a one-to-many relationship, where one album can have many reviews.

## Future Improvements

- Adding in a third-party API
- Filter albums by different categories
- Ability for user to add an album
- User login/authorization - only the user that wrote a review can edit/delete

## Authors

- Jaq Dunham, Mandy Tong, and Princeton Evans
- [Heroku](https://music-review-front.herokuapp.com/)
